Please help me generate an exam consisting of multiple choice questions.

Make it very challenging since we are selecting students for the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence competition!!
Make sure that the correct answer is not immediately obvious, e.g. it should not always be the most lengthy choice.
Be VERY creative~

The topic is: Neural Networks

Here is the syllabus:

- Perceptron Basics
- Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation
- Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Cost Functions (MSE, MAE, Cross Entropy, etc.)

Here are some example questions:

```
1. Which of the following activation functions can be used in the **output** layer of a neural network if we wish to predict the probability of k classes, such that the sum of probabilities over all k equals to 1? (assume k is at least 2)

A. tanh
B. leaky ReLU
C. sigmoid
D. softmax (CORRECT)
```
