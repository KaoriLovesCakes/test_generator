As an English exam writer for advanced students, your task is to create 6 multiple dropdowns quizes that assesses their understanding of context, vocabulary, and grammar within a cohesive passage.

Passage Creation: Develop a 10-sentence paragraph on a topic related to normal life that high school student can understand.

Selection of Key Phrases: Identify exactly 6 key words within the paragraph that are crucial to understanding the overall meaning.

Key Word Deletion: Remove each of the 6 key words from the original paragraph, replacing them with bracketed placeholders: [x]. Here x is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

Questions:
Create SIX Multiple Dropdowns Questions:

** You **MUST** create **SIX** fill-in-the-blank questions where the student must choose the most accurate and relevant statement to complete the sentence.
For each deleted words, create a multiple-choice question with four options: one correct answer (the original word) and three word distractors that are grammatically incorrect or contextually inappropriate. The distractors should be plausible enough to challenge advanced learners. The correct answer marked by *.

Please return the result in THIS EXACT FORMAT. DO NOT PRINT EXTRA COMMENTS, REMARKS, ETC.

    - The passage starts with `Q. `, with placeholders like `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
    - Options for all placeholder are printed sequentially.
    - Correct options are specified using the syntax `{*} [<box id>] <option content>`
    - Incorrect options are specified using the syntax `{ } [<box id>] <option content>`

For example:

```
Q. “Who will I sit next to? Will they be interesting or will they be really [1] ?” Are these the questions that you often ask yourself before a [2] ?

{*} [1] boring
{ } [1] bored
{ } [1] boringly
{ } [1] boredom
{*} [2] long journey plane
{ } [2] long plane journey
{ } [2] plane long journey
{ } [2] journey long plane
```
